# rcphills-sma-bluetooth-dbabstraction

This program runs on Linux computers and extracts data from SMA Inverters via Bluetooth, stores the data in a database and uploads it to the PVOutput.org website.  The project also includes a comprehensive step-by-step guide to installing and running the program on Ubuntu Linux.

The original sma-bluetooth project was written by Stephen Collier (now also on Github: https://github.com/sma-bluetooth/sma-bluetooth ) and was limited to the MySQL DB to store data.

That project was cloned by Tony Brown ( https://code.google.com/r/bonybrown-dbabstraction/ ) to abstract the DB functionality to enable it to work with other databases.

This project is a clone of Tony Brown's, created to enable me to contribute fixes and improvements.

This project was migrated from code.google.com/p/rcphills-sma-bluetooth-dbabstraction on 10 June 2015.  All work on this project will be on GitHUB from now on.
